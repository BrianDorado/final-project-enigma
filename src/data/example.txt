We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you











For the first programming assignment, you will code a console-based client application in C that uses Windows Sockets (“Winsock”) to transmit a message to a server. The server will echo the message, which will then be received and displayed by the client. A working server will be provided for testing, along with a program template that you can use as the basis for your client. You will add the Winsock function calls and related code to the client template. 
You will use Microsoft Visual C++ for all CS 2690 programming assignments. These
assignments assume that you are using Visual Studio Community or Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 or 2019. If you don’t have access to a Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 computer, you can use one of the computers in the Network Lab (CS 516) to code, compile and test. CS 516 computers run
DeepFreeze and revert to their original state each time they reboot, so be sure to build your
project on a flash drive that you can take with you when you leave the lab. The first time you use Visual Studio in the Network Lab, it will take a few minutes to set up the configuration for your user. Any UVU computer lab that has Visual Studio can be used for coding, but only CS 516 has  all of the required test software.
Program 1 will require approximately 130 lines of code and the logic is straightforward. However, there are many potential pitfalls in low-level C programming. Start right away to allow plenty of time for debugging. Make sure that you understand each data structure and function call, and test carefully
